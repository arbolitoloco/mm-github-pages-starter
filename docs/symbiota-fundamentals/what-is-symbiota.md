## Definition

To put it simply, Symbiota is an [open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) [content management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) for curating specimen- and observation-based biodiversity data.
It was originally conceived to promote small- to medium-sized, regionally and/or taxonomically themed collaborations of natural history collections.
Currently, there are hundreds of collections in North America being actively managed through Symbiota portals, and efforts are being made to expand its availability to international collections.
For a complete description of the Symbiota framework, please refer to [this article](https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/1114/element/4/690548//):
