## Definition

To put it simply, Symbiota is an [open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) [content management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) for curating specimen- and observation-based biodiversity data.

It was originally conceived to promote small- to medium-sized, regionally and/or taxonomically themed collaborations of natural history collections.

Currently, there are hundreds of collections in North America being actively managed through Symbiota portals, and efforts are being made to expand its availability to international collections.

For a complete description of the Symbiota framework, please refer to [this article](https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/1114/element/4/690548//):

## What can it do?

A Symbiota portal can:

- Host one or more separate natural history collection profiles and their specimens' data
- Provide live specimen management or snapshot datasets
- Host specimen images
- Host taxa descriptions
- Generate multi-entry identification keys
- Create and manage taxa checklists with vouchers
- Publish Darwin Core Archives 
- Send Darwin Core Archives to GBIF
- Offer different search methods (quick, advanced, map, image)
- Export search results
- Clean taxonomic names from occurrences/specimens
- Print labels
- Provide simple database statistics
- Hide protected/sensitive specimen information

## What can't it do?

For now, at least, Symbiota is not meant to:

- Manage taxonomic concepts
- Generate taxonomic catalogs
- Run complex spatial analyses
- Generate evolutionary analyses
