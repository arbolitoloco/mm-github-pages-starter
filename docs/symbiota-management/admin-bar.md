# Admin bar

As a portal admin, you have to get familiarized with its layout, so you can easily find the tools you need. The admin bar is normally located in the upper right corner of the page, right below the header. It includes links for logging in, creating new accounts, and the sitemap, which is where you will find most of the tools necessary for your work.

Alternatively, for security reasons, the admin bar is only displayed for logged in users. In that case, you have to find the `Log In` link somewhere else in the layout, often located in the footer.

## Users

The first thing you have to do is to create an account in the portal, and request admin permissions for the portal manager.

### How to create an account

1. In your Symbiota portal, in the admin bar, click on the `New Account` link.
2. Fill the form with your information, and click on the `Create Login` button.
3. Ask for a portal manager or user with appropriate permissions to assign you admin permissions.

### How to log in

1. In your Symbiota portal, in the admin bar click on the `Log In` link.
2. Add your credentials and click the `Log In` button.

## Sitemap

If you click on the `Sitemap` link, you should find a complete list of tools available in your Symbiota installation. These tools are shown depending on your user status. If you are logged out, or you are not registered in the portal, you should see the tools in these sections:

- Collections
- Image Library
- Taxonomy
- Dynamic Species Lists
- About Symbiota

If you are a portal admin, you should see an additional tool panel, called `Data Management Tools`, with the following sections:

- Administrative Functions (Super Admins only)
- Identification Keys
- Images
- Biotic Inventory Projects
- Taxon Profile Page
- Taxonomy
- Checklists
- Collections
- Observations

Some of these tools may be unavailable, depending on what types of permissions you have been assigned to different collections.

## Site tools (UW-Custom)

For UW-Madison's portal, due to the fact that it includes only snapshots of several different collections, a simplified, shortened version of the sitemap has been added, to include the tools most commonly used by admins.

The sections found in the site tools page are:

- Users
- Collections
- Taxonomy
- Image Library
- Checklists (curated lists of specimens)
- Data Publishing
